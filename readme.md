## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin that removes empty paragraphs,
left over from other operations, from the tree.
Paragraphs are considered empty if they do not contain non-whitespace
characters.

## When should I use this?

This project is mostly useful when youâ€™re using other plugins that remove things
from the AST (such as [`remark-strip-badges`][remark-strip-badges]).
You can then use this plugin afterwards to clean stray empty paragraphs.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: this plugin used to be useful, but with time the responsibility
> for cleaning the tree has shifted to the plugins that cause that.
>
> If you need this, you should also open an issue with the tools causing that.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-squeeze-paragraphs
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import remarkSqueezeParagraphs from 'https://esm.sh/remark-squeeze-paragraphs@5'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkSqueezeParagraphs from 'https://esm.sh/remark-squeeze-paragraphs@5?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkSqueezeParagraphs from 'remark-squeeze-paragraphs'
import remarkStripBadges from 'remark-strip-badges'

console.log(
  String(
    await remark()
      .use(remarkStripBadges)
      .process('![](https://img.shields.io/)\n\ntext')
  )
)
// => '\n\ntext\n'

console.log(
  String(
    await remark()
      .use(remarkStripBadges)
      .use(remarkSqueezeParagraphs)
      .process('![](https://img.shields.io/)\n\ntext')
  )

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is
[`remarkSqueezeParagraphs`][api-remark-squeeze-paragraphs].

### `unified().use(remarkSqueezeParagraphs)`

Remove empty (or white space only) paragraphs.

###### Parameters

There are no parameters.

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line,
`remark-squeeze-paragraphs@^5`, compatible with Node.js 12.

This plugin works with `unified` version 3+ and `remark` version 4+.

## Security

Use of `remark-squeeze-paragraphs` does not involve **[rehype][]**
(**[hast][]**) or user content so there are no openings for [cross-site
scripting (XSS)][wiki-xss] attacks.
